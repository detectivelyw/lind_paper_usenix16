\section{Introduction}
\label{sec.introduction}

To run multiple applications on a computer, it is critical to securely
manage access to the machine's underlying hardware. 
In modern computer systems, either a hypervisor - a virtual machine monitor (VMM), or an
operating system (OS) kernel performs this important function. Unfortunately, code within an OS kernel 
may contain flaws and vulnerabilities that can be triggered in an attack by a malicious adversary. 
If this occurs, an attacker could have unrestricted access to the system.

%One critical flaw, discovered in the Linux kernel in the \texttt{futex} subsystem call can allow an attacker to
%gain ring 0 control via the \texttt{futex} syscall, and potentially execute arbitrary code
%with kernel mode privileges~\cite{CVE-2014-3153}. \cappos{Possibly omit this sentence.}

There are several defensive %technologies 
mechanisms including OS virtualization (i.e., Xen,
 KVM, VirtualBox), system call filtering \cite{Janus:99},\cite{SCI-04},
and library OSes \cite{Bascule},\cite{Drawbridge-11} that have been developed with the aim of 
protecting OS kernels. Common security wisdom holds that running software in a
virtual machinecan prevent an attacker from exploiting flaws in the underlying
kernel. However, exactly how secure is virtualization? \cite{Tal}. As we will
demonstrate in this paper, even with virtualization techniques employed, one
third of the vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel are still vulnerable to exploitation.

%However, 
Limiting access to kernel code by itself is insufficent to build a secure virtualization system because of two issues. 
First, if a complex program can not access a part of the kernel, its functionality must exist somewhere else or the program will not work. 
Second, it is typical for virtualization systems to add new privileged code as their TCB.
As a result, a vulnerability in the privileged codebase is as much of a security risk as a flaw in the kernel. 
CVE-2008-2100 and CVE-2011-1751 are two examples of weaknesses in the virtualized system, where exploits from guest to host OS have been possible. 
In CVE-2008-2100, a vulnerability in VMWare's codebase was caused by buffer overflows in the VIX API. 
This could allow local users to bypass the guest VM and gain privilege escalation to execute arbitrary code in the host OS, 
even shellcode to access the kernel of the host OS. In CVE-2011-1751, missing check in KVM's QEMU emulation of PCI-ISA bridge 
could allow an attacker for root exploit in the host OS being triggered from a guest \cite{Virtunoid}. 

%\cappos{Revise this paragraph further}\lois{as we discussed, replace these two vague examples with one example described in more detail}

%\lois{transition is needed here. There is no connection made between virtualization techniques and where kernel vulnerabilities exist} 

%For this purpose, we examined 40 kernel patches designed to fix severe Linux kernel security bugs and analyzed the lines where those bugs occurred. 
%The results show that kernel paths used by popular applications contain fewer security bugs, and therefore, can be exposed with less risk.

This paper presents Lind, a new approach for shielding privileged code from untrusted programs through controlled kernel access. 
For this purpose, a metric was developed that helps to identify likely locations within the kernel where vulnerabilities may exist 
by examining 40 kernel bug fixing patches. We validated the proposed metric and built a new design %for virtualizationsystems 
called ``safely-reimplement'' that restricts access to only the
kernel paths that are mostly used by common applications. 

%\lois{for all vrtualization systems?} 
%To restrict the privileged code, we first build a minimal, sandboxed environment that also only uses common kernel paths. 
%We then implement a POSIX interface inside of this safe sandbox. For complex and dangerous system functions, 
%which may access the risky portion of the kernel, input to POSIX is reimplemented by our own code within a sandbox. 
%Any bugs or failures within the implementation of those complex system functions will be contained by the sandbox, 
%and will not have the chance to reach and trigger risky portions of the kernel. Because of this added security, 
%we dub this as a "safe-reimplementation" design. Therefore, even if the code is vulnerable to an attack, 
%it is unable to trigger kernel paths that are less commonly used or tested.\lois{I think this paragraph needs to be simplified. 
%I think the level of detail is too high for an introduction paragraph}
%This new design helped us to understand which kernel paths are hardest to safely-reimplement and 
%provided key insights about what kernel paths system designers should give the highest degree of scrutiny. 
%In turn, we then use this design paradigm to develop a virtualization system called Lind.
%\lois{and Lind is developed to do what? Is it just another virtualization system?} 

We built the  ``safely-reimplement'' within a minimal sandbox based on Repy ~\cite{Repy-10} - the POSIX implementation 
to limit access to the kernel - and  integrated it with the Google Native client for software fault isolation through memory safety of the application. 
Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of our solution by running applications withing Lind and other virtualization systems 
through comparing the kernel traces produces by each application. 
The results show that applications run in Lind were the least likely to trigger kernel bugs, 
with only one out of the 35 kernel vulnerabilities tested being found for an effectiveness rate of 2.9\%. 
In contrast, the virtualization systems built without our metric triggered more vulnerabilities (23-40\%).  

%To evaluate the effectiveness of Lind, we first captured the kernel traces from user programs run in Lind and four other virtualization systems.  
%These traces were then compared against historical kernel bug reports to verify which trace was more likely to trigger bugs. 
%Results showed that applications run in Lind were the least likely to trigger kernel bugs, with only one out of the 35 kernel vulnerabilities 
%tested being found for an effectiveness rate of 2.9\%. In contrast, the virtualization systems built without our metric triggered more vulnerabilities (23-40\%). 
%This suggests that our metric can help effectively design and build more secure virtualization systems.

In summary, 
%\lois{I inserted "in summary," but I don't think this is quite enough. A transition is needed} 
the main contributions of this paper are as follows. %\cappos{revise}
\begin{itemize}
\item
We propose and validate a novel metric for quantitatively measuring and
evaluating the security of privileged code, such as in an OS kernel.
The proposed metric is used to examines the safety of the kernel trace at the lines-of-code level.
%\yanyan{what is "generated by producing design recommendations"?}

%\item Validating the key hypothesis that commonly used kernel paths contain fewer bugs, as predicted by our metric.

\item
We use the metric to build a secure ``safely-reimplement'' design that
involves reimplementation of risky system calls inside a
sandbox that only uses safe kernel paths.
%that commonly used kernel paths contain fewer bugs.

\item
With this new design, we implement a sandbox security system called Lind
that provides a isolated environment for applications and strong protection for the kernel.

\item 
We conducted empirical evaluation of the Lind system to confirm its architectural goals such as strong security and usability. 
Through a quantitative analysis for sandboxes, we show that only 2.9\% of vulnarabilities in Linux kernel has been triggered in Lind.

%We implement Lind and find \gholami{I think this is not a contribution rather it is more results of evaulations} it triggers 
%only one (2.9\%) of the kernel vulnerabilities we examined. This suggests that our metric can help design and 
%build virtualization systemswith greater security.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section \ref{sec.motivation-and-background} describes the motivation that drove our work and key background material.
Section \ref{sec.metric}, introduces the proposed kernel security metric. The
``safely-reimplement'' design pattern derived from this metric is then discussed in Section \ref{sec.design}. Section \ref{sec.implementation},
explains the significant features of Lind, the kernel security system developed
from the design pattern explained in the previous section. In Section \ref{sec.evaluation} the security and 
efficiency of Lind is tested against other virtualization systems. 
Section \ref{sec.limitation} outlines the current
limitations of the Lind prototype and possible future initiatives.
Finally, Section \ref{sec.related_work} reviews existing tools and techniques that share
Lind's security techniques and goals, and we conclude our remarks in
Section \ref{sec.conclusion}.
