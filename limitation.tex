\section{Limitations and Future Work}
\label{sec.limitation}

We discuss the limitations of Lind in this section. 
First, our metric relies on identifying lines of
code in the kernel that are executed when running applications in secure
systems. In our future work we will explore if the bug metric works well for
operating system virtual machines with a hypervisor.  It is not clear if
existing hypervisors are small and compact enough that effectively all paths
are common paths or whether there is still substantial benefit from our metric.

A second limitation is that our criteria for determining if a kernel trace is
safe or risky was to  check it against a list of historical kernel bugs.
However, not all bugs can be accurately checked in this manner. For
example, bugs that are caused by a race condition cannot be identified by
directly checking if certain lines of code are executed. For complicated
bugs that involve defects in the internal kernel data structures, or
require complex triggering conditions across multiple kernel paths, our
metric will not be able to accurately determine whether or not those bugs
have been triggered. In such cases, more complex metrics might be needed
for detection.  

%While Lind executes programs like Apache and Tor, it does not
%support every system call or every possible set of arguments. For example,
%symbolic links are not supported.  While the SafePOSIX implementation could
%be extended to do so, we leave this for future work. Also, as mentioned in
%the previous section, 
Lind has not been optimized for performance, so the
results we present here should be taken as a baseline. 
%of what is possible. 
We would like to explore what existing OSVM optimizations can be safely
applied and what their impact is.

%There were also some avenues we intentionally excluded in this initial
%study that could form the basis for interesting research projects in the
%future. First, we chose not to explore bugs within the applications
%themselves.

We would also like to test our metric in other
popular operating systems, such as Windows and Mac OS. Our experiments were
limited to Linux kernel 3.14.1 and some of the typical virtualization
systems that existed in Linux. It would be interesting 
%and beneficial to the advance of secure systems 
if similar tests could be
run in other widely-used operating systems.  In particular, it would
be interesting to see if having the host and guest VM utilize different
operating systems provides better protection.
