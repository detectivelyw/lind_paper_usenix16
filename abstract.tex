\subsection*{Abstract}
Building secure systems that allow untrusted programs to run without
triggering inherent vulnerabilities %in the underlying privileged code of an
%operating system (OS) kernel or hypervisor
is very challenging.
%Despite substantial effort by o
%eliminate these flaws,
Through techniques such as system call interposition,
operating system virtualization, and library OSes, security researchers
and system developers have attempted to minimize the risk of such flaws.
However, these technologies can add new code to the system's TCB that often has new
exploitable vulnerabilities. 
In addition, the complex functions that these systems use can enable access
to portions of the underlying kernel that could trigger these flaws.
%In addition, the portions of the underlying kernel
%that these systems use can open contact to complex calls that can trigger these
%flaws.

This paper introduces a new metric to determine where kernel flaws are
likely to be located, based on the  hypothesis that commonly-used kernel
paths, executed by popular applications on a daily basis, contain fewer
vulnerabilities than less-used paths. With this insight, we devise the
safely-reimplement design, a new technique that limits kernel access to only
commonly used paths, and reimplements complex OS functions within a sandbox.

Finally, we use this design to prototype and test a secure virtualization system called Lind.
The results show that for the 35 bugs we examined in Linux kernel version 3.14.1, 
Lind can reduce the threat of attacks on the OS kernel to less than 3\%.
This result is about an order of magnitude better than existing systems like VirtualBox (40\%),
VMWare Workstation (31\%), Docker (23\%), LXC (34\%), QEMU (14\%), KVM (14\%), and Graphene (23\%).
