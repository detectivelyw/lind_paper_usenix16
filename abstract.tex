\subsection*{Abstract}
Building secure systems that allow untrusted programs to run without
triggering inherent vulnerabilities %in the underlying privileged code of an
%operating system (OS) kernel or hypervisor
is very challenging. Despite
substantial effort by security researchers and system developers to
eliminate these flaws, through techniques such as system call filtering,
operating system virtualization, and library OSes, much still needs to be done
to make existing OS kernels secure against intentional or unintentional
triggering of these vulnerabilities.
%\gholami{maybe rephrase to: ... these flaws, still it is long away to make
existing OS kernels secure.} The limitations of these techniques are two-fold.
First, these systems add trusted code that often has new
exploitable vulnerabilities. Second, the portions of the underlying kernel
that these systems use open these vulnerabilities to exploitation.
As a result, developers can not fully prevent buggy programs from triggering
flaws, or attackers from leveraging these bugs.
%for their own purposes.

%\cappos{Rework...}
In this paper, we introduce a novel security design that leverages
controlled kernel access to protect privileged code from exploitation by
untrusted programs.
%\gholami {Maybe to say it's called Lind instead of mentioning it at the end of this paragraph}
%We start by analyzing the effectiveness of existing
%solutions and explore the reasons why existing techniques are not
%effective. \gholami {I think this sentence is good inside the paper than abstract?}
We first propose a new metric to determine where kernel flaws are
likely to be located, based on a hypothesis that commonly-used kernel
paths, executed by applications on a daily basis, contain fewer
vulnerabilities than less-used paths. With this insight, we devise a
novel design that implements essential OS functionality inside a
secure sandbox, minimizing contact between the kernel and riskier system calls.
% \gholami {is this rephrase of the first sentence?}
Finally, we use this design to prototype and test a secure system called Lind.
The results show that executing malicious code in Lind can reduce the threat of
attacks on the OS kernel to less than 3%.
%an attacker executing code inside Lind can trigger less than
3%. This result is about an order of
magnitude less than existing systems like VirtualBox (40\%),
VMWare Workstation (31\%), Docker (23\%), and Graphene (23\%).
