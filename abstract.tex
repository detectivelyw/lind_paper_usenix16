\subsection*{Abstract}
Building secure systems that allow untrusted programs to run without
triggering inherent vulnerabilities %in the underlying privileged code of an
%operating system (OS) kernel or hypervisor
is very challenging. 
%Despite substantial effort by security researchers and system developers to
%eliminate these flaws, through 
Techniques such as system call filtering,
operating system virtualization, and library OSes have been designed to  
eliminate these vulnerabilities.
%much still needs to be done
%to make existing OS kernels secure against intentional or unintentional
%triggering of these vulnerabilities.
%\gholami{maybe rephrase to: ... these flaws, still it is long away to make
%existing OS kernels secure.} 
However, 
%the limitations of these techniques are two-fold. First, 
these systems add trusted code that often has new
exploitable vulnerabilities, and the portions of the underlying kernel
that these systems use open these vulnerabilities to exploitation.
%As a result, developers can not fully prevent buggy programs from triggering
%flaws, or attackers from leveraging these bugs.
%for their own purposes.

%\cappos{Rework...}
We introduce a novel security design that leverages
controlled kernel access to protect privileged code from exploitation by
untrusted programs.
%\gholami {Maybe to say it's called Lind instead of mentioning it at the end of this paragraph}
%We start by analyzing the effectiveness of existing
%solutions and explore the reasons why existing techniques are not
%effective. \gholami {I think this sentence is good inside the paper than abstract?}
We first propose a new metric to determine where kernel flaws are
likely to be located, based on a hypothesis that commonly-used kernel
paths, executed by popular applications on a daily basis, contain fewer
vulnerabilities than less-used paths. With this insight, we devise a
novel design that implements essential OS functionality in  a
secure sandbox, minimizing contact between the kernel and riskier system calls.
% \gholami {is this rephrase of the first sentence?}
Our evaluation shows that Lind can reduce the threat of
executing malicious code in the kernel to less than 3\%.
%an attacker executing code inside Lind can trigger less than 3\%. 
This result is about an order of magnitude less than existing systems like VirtualBox (40\%),
VMWare Workstation (31\%), Docker (23\%), LXC (34\%), QEMU (14\%), KVM (14\%), and Graphene (23\%).
